# Regression Catalog

Authoritative list of regression tests that MUST exist and pass before release.
Each entry links to the asserting test(s). Removing an entry requires explicit
user approval.

Status key: `E` = exists and passing | `P` = partial | `M` = missing.

## Subject Governance (Phase H — 2026-04-15)

Source: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-subject-governance-design.md` §11.3

| # | Test name | Asserts | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SG-1 | `class_6_free_plan_no_senior_subjects` | Grade 6 free-plan student never sees Physics/Chemistry/Biology/Accountancy in API, hook, picker, or PATCH preferences | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |
| SG-2 | `api_never_returns_global_subject_list` | `GET /api/student/subjects` returns a strict subset of the canonical 17 for every student profile | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |
| SG-3 | `grade_11_commerce_excludes_physics` | Grade 11 commerce stream RPC + validator excludes physics/chemistry/biology | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |
| SG-4 | `grade_11_science_excludes_accountancy` | Grade 11 science stream RPC + validator excludes accountancy/business_studies | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |
| SG-5 | `plan_downgrade_clamps_selected_subjects` | Downgrading pro → starter surfaces previously-allowed subjects as `is_locked=true` and `validateSubjectWrite` rejects with reason='plan' | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |
| SG-6 | `admin_delete_flags_without_deleting_enrollments` | Admin DELETE on `plan_subject_access` flags affected students in the violations report; `student_subject_enrollment` rows are preserved until ops repair | `src/__tests__/regression-subject-leak.test.tsx` | E |

### E2E coverage

Playwright spec `e2e/subject-governance.spec.ts` — three scenarios from §11.5:

- Grade 11 science onboarding: stream capture → subject picker excludes accountancy → dashboard shows only stream-valid subjects.
- Legacy user with invalid enrollment: ReselectBanner visible → reselect → no invalid subjects surface.
- Plan downgrade: post-refresh dashboard has no unlocked physics/chemistry/biology chips.

### Invariants covered by this section

- P5 (grade format — strings)
- P8 (RLS boundary — governance service on server)
- P9 (RBAC enforcement — 422 on write, 200 on read-only allowed intersection)

## Foxy Moat Plan — Phases 0-3 (2026-04-26)

Source: Foxy moat plan Phases 0-3 — NCERT-link removal, Voyage rerank,
RRF retrieval, pedagogy prompt rewrite with coachMode, /api/foxy/remediation
endpoint, misconception ontology schema.

| # | Test name | Asserts | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| REG-36 | `foxy_api_no_sources_or_diagrams` | `/api/foxy` POST/GET responses (grounded path, hard-abstain, legacy intent-router fallback, history) never expose `sources` or `diagrams` fields. Closes the moat-leak vector where competitors could scrape NCERT chapter URLs from prod traffic. | `src/__tests__/foxy-api-no-sources.test.ts` | E |
| REG-37 | `foxy_voyage_rerank_fallback` | When `VOYAGE_API_KEY` is unset, fetch throws, returns non-2xx, or returns malformed JSON, the rerank step is bypassed and similarity-ranked top-N is returned. Voyage rerank is a single-point-of-failure on top of RRF — student traffic must continue to flow on outage. | `src/__tests__/foxy-rerank-fallback.test.ts` (parity) + `supabase/functions/grounded-answer/__tests__/` (Deno) | E |
| REG-38 | `foxy_coach_mode_default_is_mastery_driven` | `resolveCoachMode(requested, mastery)` picks 'socratic' for mastery < 0.6, 'answer' for ≥ 0.6 when no explicit mode is requested. Explicit valid mode (`socratic` / `answer` / `review`) wins. Invalid mode falls back to mastery default. NaN/Infinity/out-of-range mastery clamps safely. | `src/__tests__/foxy-coach-mode.test.ts` | E |
| REG-39 | `foxy_remediation_cache_prevents_duplicate_anthropic_calls` | `/api/foxy/remediation`: cache hit on `wrong_answer_remediations(question_id, distractor_index)` returns cached text without invoking Anthropic. Cache miss calls Anthropic exactly once and persists. `distractor_index` outside 0..3 → 400 (P6). `ai_usage_global=false` → 503, no Anthropic call. | `src/__tests__/foxy-remediation-cache.test.ts` | E |
| REG-40 | `/api/foxy/remediation oracle shape uniform — P3 anti-cheat defense-in-depth` | Every non-eligible request to `/api/foxy/remediation` (distractor==correct, never attempted, different distractor than submitted, answered correctly, attestation DB error) returns BYTE-IDENTICAL `403 { success:false, error:'remediation_unavailable' }`. Cache table, question table, and Anthropic are NEVER touched on the failure path so timing and DB-load patterns cannot leak which branch failed. | `src/__tests__/foxy-remediation-oracle-shape.test.ts` | E |

### Invariants covered by this section

- P12 (AI safety — kill switch enforced before generation; cache prevents
  unbounded Anthropic spend)
- P6 (question quality — distractor index validated as 0..3 only)
- P10 (bundle/cost budget — rerank fallback keeps the worker hot path
  deterministic when Voyage degrades)
- Moat protection — sources/diagrams stripped from the student-facing
  envelope on every code path

### Notes on test strategy

Three of the four files are **contract/parity tests** following the same
pattern as `foxy-plan-normalization.test.ts` and `foxy-grounded-gate.test.ts`:
they replicate the function logic locally and assert on the contract. This
is deliberate — `/api/foxy/remediation` (Phase 3) and the rerank logic
(Deno-side) cannot be mounted in Vitest without re-mocking 6+ modules
that already have integration coverage at the E2E layer. If the
implementation in `src/app/api/foxy/route.ts`,
`src/app/api/foxy/remediation/route.ts`, or
`supabase/functions/grounded-answer/` diverges from the parity copy
in these tests, quality review must reject and the parity copy must be
re-synced.
